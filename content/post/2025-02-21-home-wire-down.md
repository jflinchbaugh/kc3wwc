The rope came undone at far end
of my EFRW.
I had to fish it back down
with a wire hook stuck
in a fishing pole.

The SWR was a bit high,
and I found broken wires
in 9:1 balun,
so stripped the wires
and reassembled it.

With the antenna working again,
I contacted [New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia)
on 10M FT8 with 8W.
