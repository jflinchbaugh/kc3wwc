### My Week in Radio

#### Contesting
I finished the FT Challenge.
There was no special exchange this year.
We could use other defined subbands
in addition to the regular frequencies
to alleviate crowding.
We could work anyone,
even if they're not
_participating_ explicitly.

I operated QRP,
so it was nice to find the quieter subbands
and more FT4 activity.
You earned multipliers for each 3000km,
so I don't really know on my score yet.

I found [`wsjtx-improved`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt-x-improved/)
on the Debian Linux repository,
so used that.
I saw the color improvements,
the better location labels with states,
and it had filters.

#### AllStar
I learning some obvious things about AllStar:
it can't hear my DTMF if it's currently transmitting,
since it's simplex,
so it's hard to control on a busy net.


#### Yagi in the Wind
Finally,
I watched my home-built yagi flapping
around on that windy day.
I guess I can stop worrying about it,
since it held up fine.
