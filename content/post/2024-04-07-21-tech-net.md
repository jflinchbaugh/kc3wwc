### My Week in Amateur Radio
- Overload on UV-K5 with better antennas
  - UV-K5 & UV-K6 for comparison - not broken
  - Balance antenna location good enough but not _too_ good
  - FM bandstop filter helps a whole lot
<!--more-->
- Modifying params database on Xiegu X6100
  - Now shows me accurate bands and privileges, 
    so I won't accidentally wander beyond my privileges.
- Picked up an Evolve 3 laptop that runs on 12v
  - Linux is being challenging: wifi and sound.
- Packing camera and radio gear or eclipse trip tomorrow
