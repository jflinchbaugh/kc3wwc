I have a dipole that's 20m long (10m each side) 
strung through the house
right to the banana plug adapter 
to the radio and no coax.
I've coiled the wires together
at the feed point 
to shorten and tune.
I can run 40m with tuner turned off.
I'm hitting Europe, Central America, Canada, 
and the midwest US.

I figure, 
since the wires are insulated 
and kept parallel to each other,
the coil is serving as feed line
and not part of the antenna.
