### My Week in Radio
- KC3TMZ, Matt:
  - 3d-printing and building antennas is great
- Trying to build a tactical delta loop
  - 4:1 balun
  - 2 17 ft whips
  - 25 ft wire for the top
  - 3d-printed base
  - not great so far
  - will be using the 4:1 with other antennas, like rybakov
- ISS pass with APRS
  - decoded relayed packets from Pittsburgh PA, Smyrna DE, Atlanta GA.
- Bluetooth control of a radio is pretty convenient, big phone screen
### Others

  - organizing the shack
  - working on lesson plan for technician review to prep for general
    - short videos / presentations
    - can arrange to do some teaching up here instead of just in delaware
- N3CRE, Charlie:
  - trying to hook a headset to FTM-500
- W3EMF, Jerry:
  - originator of the Workbench Net
  - new 2M rig in vehicle to access 985 more
### Questions
- KC3TMZ, Matt:
  - Purchased a new antenna that may want ground radials.
    What's the best way to connect temporary radials to an antenna?
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - is removable a requirement?
  - KC3TMZ, Matt:
    - radials can stay, stapled to the ground
    - he wants to remove the vertical element, so dogs don't tangle leashes
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - terminate all radials to 1 ring terminal and screw that right
      to a ground rod
    - it's a 20/15/10M trapped vertical (he sold it to him)
      - doesn't need guyed
  - KC3TMZ, Matt:
    - liking the idea of a metal pipe into which he can just drop the antenna
  - WA3KFT, John:
    - worked in a AM broadcast
    - drive a pipe into the ground to slip antenna into or onto
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - drive a pipe into the ground, flush
    - has a PVC pipe that holds up an inverted-v
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - copper braid with ring terminals, inexpensive on amazon
    - be careful to not short feed with ground in metal pipe socket
- KC3NZT, Harvey:
  - magmonut often comes with a length of coax.
    is there a magmount wiht an SO-239
    so you can do use whatever coax you want?
  - W8CRW, CR:
    - make your own.
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - make your own.
  - KC3SQI, Wayne:
    - there is a bulkhead mount
      with SO-239 for the antenna that could be
      added to the magnet
  - K3YVQ, Jack:
    - there's an empty magnet mount
- KC3WWC, John:
  I have a talent, how do we avoid doubling during checkin?
  - AF3Z, Jim:
    - don't worry about it
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - silent "this is". grab carrier, drop it, then give call.
  - KC3SQI, Wayne:
    - some nets use "this is" protocol. that lowers the chance
    - net host resolves it
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - click method, and it doesn't matter
  - AF3Z, Jim:
    - bigger issue is digital link people and leaving enough space
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - pulse/click method, silent "this is"
    - net control watches for doubles
    - net contral asks for checkins
- K3YVQ, Jack:
  - Can I combine 2 batteries of different capacities
    in paralllel on a bus to get larger capacity?
  - WA3KFT, John:
    - yes, it'll work.
    - has a bus with power supply and battery on a bus of banana plugs
    - ok if they're the same voltage
    - plug the batteries on the ends, and radios in the middle
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - batteries are sometimes limited on max current
    - lithium batteries' voltage drops very late in discharge
    - a deader battery could be a strong current draw
  - K3YVQ, Jack:
    - they have BCM, so they protect themselves.
    - may look into 12V cigarette lighter to power pole charger.
- N3CRE, Charlie:
  - Having trouble pairing a wireless BT headset with FTM-500.
  - K3YVQ, Jack:
    - check that the bluetooth protocols are compatible
    - maybe a firmware upgrade will fix it
### After Party
- KC3NZT, Harvey:
  - when we lack questions, we should present little lectures
    on testing and equipment.
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - has demonstrated diagnosing feed line problems
  - NA3CW, Chuck:
    - some things can be explained verbally, others more visual
  - KC3NZT, Harvey:
    - a list of resourcse and videos could live on 985 website
  - WA3VEE, Ron:
    - lots of zoom practice with document camera, etc in his shack
  - KC3WWC, John:
    - I'll bring my balun around for diagnosis on video
    - I have watched a video on using nano vna to test filters and baluns
    - I like to optimistically use it first, then dig in more if needed
    - I think that keeps me doing stuff that I might otherwise not realize to be possible
    - document my beginner experiences on a blog for my reference and others
  - W3EMF, Jerry:
    - echolink in the mobile
    - calling from Elizabethtown
