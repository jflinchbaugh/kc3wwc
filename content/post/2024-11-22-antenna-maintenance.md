The home-brew yagi blows around in the wind a bit,
so I brought it down this morning as it started to snow,
so I could straighten and tighten the elements.
I realigned it for the 985 repeater,
and checked it to be giving -96dBd.

I also resoldered some radials on the 1/4-wave ground plane antenna
that go knocked loose in the tree.
