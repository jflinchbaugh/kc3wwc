I ran some errands
and wandered off to
[Susquehannock State Park, US-1425](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1425)
to play.
I started with SSB phone,
and immediately heard Hawaii.
The bands were busy with QSO Parties
for Hawaii, Kansas, and Ohio,
so I kept hunting people
and easily got my 13 contacts.
I never switched to the computer
for digital modes!

In addition to the QSO parties,
I caught a contact from Italy
and [K8MRD of Ham Radio Tube](https://www.youtube.com/@hamradiotube)
in a park in Texas.
I bothered one last operator with a little CW,
but I failed pretty badly.
The radio was decoding for me,
but my keying wasn't up to the job.
