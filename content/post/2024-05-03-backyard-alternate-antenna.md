I cleaned up the backyard a bit,
and ran a new 12.5m (41ft) random wire
up the hill behind the house.

My first tests the next day
on 30m at 1W
got me some contacts.
By 4:40pm EDT,
the bands were all in "poor" condition,
so it got tough to test.

The next morning,
I watched the 40m band close.
It was ablaze at 8am,
but getting pretty quiet
by 10:30am EDT.

I compared the old antenna out the front
with the new antenna out the back using FT8
and [PSKReporter](https://pskreporter.info/pskmap.html?preset&callsign=kc3wwc&timerange=86400&hideunrec=1&blankifnone=1&hidepink=1&hidelight=1&showgrid=1&showsnr=1&mapCenter=34.91166211306687,-70.93122863617343,3.698066833465138).

The back antenna
saw fewer decodes on 15m on average.
It mostly lacked any stations from Europe.
Looking at the antenna's physical attributes,
it starts on first floor
(lower than the old antenna)
in backyard,
but it slopes up more vertically.
The middle of the antenna,
on average,
is blocked
by the hill to the East.

The old antenna
out the front
saw more decodes overall,
including Europe.
It starts at second floor window
and only slightly angles up.
The whole antenna is higher
and clears the hill, even though
Europe may still be mostly all the end
of the antenna.
It performs better.

I had fun physically
launching the new antenna,
but I'll need
to do some more work to get more
of it higher in the air
to be useful.
