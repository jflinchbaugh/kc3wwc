I assembled a new 71-ft (21.56m) EFRW 
and strung it up at Emily's.
It's 5-6ft off the ground. 
I give it a 17-ft (5.2m) counterpoise
and a 9:1 unun as usual.
2:30pm EST,
1W into it gets me midwest to a little bit of Europe
on 10m. I'm not making many contacts, 
so I bumped up to 5W.

The antenna tunes on 40m too just fine. 
I'm getting a few more contacts there.

As a new strategy,
I'm aiming for ALC around 1.0,
instead of just below any movement.
This allows me to not touch
the power slider in WSJT-X quite so much.
