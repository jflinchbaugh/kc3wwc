[https://www.radioddity.com/pages/xiegu-download](Radioddity)
had the new firmware for the X6100.
I downloaded it, wrote it, installed it, and rebooted it
to see the stock APP 1.1.8 and BASE 1.1.7.
That mostly-useless audio spectrum is gone.
The strange jump at 63 in RF GAIN is fixed.

BUT transmitting gave NO POWER.
R1CBU also exhibited the problem.
When I downgraded to BASE 1.1.6,
it transmitted again.
Others had seen this problem as well,
while others had it work.
It must have depended upon variations
in the hardware.
