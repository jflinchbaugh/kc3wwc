### W3RRR Ham Fest
I passed  the test for Amateur Extra:
40/50 correct.
I needed 37 correct.

### US-4567, Captain John Smith Trail

- POTA with Matthew, KC3WRY,
  at the boat launch under train tracks south of Marietta.
- FT8 on 20M
- 1 CW P2P contact on 20M. I didn't fumble so much.
- I used the newly-printed and rebuilt EFHW winder
  and throw line.
  The velcro strap remains a problem for snagging the line.
