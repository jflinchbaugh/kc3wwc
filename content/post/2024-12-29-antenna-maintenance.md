The 1/4-wave ground plane antenna
in the tree
dropped its feedline,
so I brought it down to reattach it
and resolder the radials.

I also walked down the yagi on the pole to straighten some elements,
since it was a nice day.
The yagi was spinning around in the wind,
so I also changed the way it's mounted
to clamp it more securely.
