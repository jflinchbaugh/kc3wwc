I activated [US-9719 Susquehanna Riverlands](https://pota.app/#/park/US-9719).
The tempurature was  decent, though a little bit of a mist.
I got lots of practice throwing very high in the tree.
I used all my throw line to hoist my EFHW into the air.
Some people lingered to watch
while I struggled to get just the right branch.

I found a large section of coax was bad,
so had to scramble a little to get enough cable.
I worked 20M
to get 2 CW park-to-park contacts
and 28 more FT4 contacts
