There were only 3 of us
at the SPARC elmer night,
but we were on the same page.
I compared notes on packet/APRS and WoAD with KC3QEH, JJ.
We both had these new Btech-based radios.
Even on the hill,
our HTs with small antennas didn't pick up much
inside the building.
I tried an external antenna
from another club radio
and I started receiving lots of packets.
Sending APRS messages worked under the Signal menu: `KC3QEH-7:TEST MSG`
