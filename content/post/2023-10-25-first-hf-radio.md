_(After passing the test, 
I immediately ordered a Quansheng UV-K5 HT.
I also ordered this weird $120 HF radio based
off the open source [usdx project](https://github.com/threeme3/usdx). 
The HF radio was garbage: 
the screen was tiny, 
the audio/CAT control was confusing or non-existent,
and it liked to lock up and stop updating its screen.
I returned it to Amazon.)_

I had been in a hurry,
since I was heading to Florida for the week.
While I was down there, 
I discovered the [Ham Radio Outlet](https://www.hamradio.com/)
in Orlando, so I ran there to look around
and purchased the [Xiegu X6100](https://xiegu.eu/product/xiegu-x6100-hf-50mhz-portable-sdr-transceiver/)
QRP rig.

I also picked up a couple accessories shortly afterward to go with it:
- connectors between bnc and sma
- 5W adjustable power supply that didn't quite cut it all the time (24Vx5W)
- 10w adjustable power supply (12Vx10W)
- speaker wire
- banana clip connectors
