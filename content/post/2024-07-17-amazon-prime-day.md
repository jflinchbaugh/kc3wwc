Prime Day popped up a few good-enough sales,
so I bought a few things.

- 50w dummy load
- TIDradio td-h8 - HT, 10W, bluetooth, clear case, etc
- TYT TH-UV8000D - HT, 10W, crossband repeater
  - This should allow me to crossband relay to a repeater
    via the outside antenna
    and wander the house with a smaller HT
- BNC adapters for HTs.
  - Everything goes to BNC for easy swapping to external antennas.
- 4 HSY Telescoping VHF/UHF antennas with BNC connectors for HTs
- TinySA
- Sony headphones, wired, as backup
  for the ones I use now for POTA
- 2 Pi Zero W kits with cases, connectors, and all that
- 375ft of micro cord for throwing antennas into trees
