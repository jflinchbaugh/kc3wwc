### The Working Configuration
I've gotten APRS working with my current gear.
I'm running my UV-K5 running egzumer 0.22.0 and VOX enabled.
I set the radio volume pretty high,
about 75%,
and connected the BTech APRS cable 
and a USB-C 3.5mm audio adapter 
to my Pixel 6 Pro for an audio connection.
The volume on the phone was set 
to nearly 100% volume.
I ran APRSDroid in AFSK mode on the phone.

I watched for my position to show up 
on the map on https://aprs.fi/.

### The Stuff That Didn't Work

With nunu firmware, 
I needed to key it manually, 
but it worked.
VOX didn't work in the nunu 0.20.5, 
so I switch back to egzumer
for working VOX.
  
### Next Steps

I'll next try to find an old phone to run the APRSDroid
and try to use the Explorer QRZ-1,
so I can dedicate some hardware to this project.
