I launched the newly-tuned slim-jim antenna.
With it hanging from the fan, it looked tuned.
Hanging right next to the siding outside the window, it looked long.

I launched it into the tree
to hang right below the quarter-wave.
Hanging in the tree, it looks well-tuned.
I compared both antennas simultaneously with the 2 Quanshengs,
and the lower slim jim measures 10-20dBm lower
than the higher quarter-wave when receiving.
