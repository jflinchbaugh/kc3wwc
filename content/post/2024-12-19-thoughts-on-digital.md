Ham radio is a long hobby.
I don't really want to rag chew,
so I started in FT8/FT4.
I got lots of practice
and learned about propagation
with help of pskreporter and other operators.
FT8/FT4 works with low power at home or portable.

I bridged into RTTY and PSK contesting for the next challenge
and a bit of excitement interacting with another human
keyboard-to-keyboard.
I had to wait for contests
for activity on RTTY or PSK.

Next, I'm learning CW, the original digital mode.
It has the benefit
of being common to see every day
in POTA and in contests.
CW is still low power and weak signal.
It's exciting to learn the skill to key and to copy.
I can currently key,
but I need assistance to copy
with computer or radio.

Digital has been a fulfilling path
through amateur radio so far.
