The one-page document
that comes with the antenna
detailing the jumper positions on the coil
and the lengths at which to set the whip for each band
didn't seem to match up all that well,
which led to some frustration out in the field.

I decided to use my NanoVNA
to reconstruct my own instructions
for using the antenna.
I extended the whip fully
and recorded the resonant frequency
for each jumper position of the coil.
Knowing those frequencies,
I can set the jumper
and shorten the whip
until the SWR sweep
on my x6100 is happy.
The SWR graph on the x6100
can be misleading sometimes,
because it often shows a _birdie_ dip
or 2 in the graph,
but now I'll always know
that I'm to shorten the whip
to get where I need to be.

I'll eventually apply labels
to the coil with these frequencies.
