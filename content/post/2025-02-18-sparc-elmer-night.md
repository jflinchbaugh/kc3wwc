I took along the old slim jim antenna
I bought at my first ham fest.
I understand now better how to tune it:
I need to make it a little longer,
not just slide the feed point up
and down the batch.

The antenna was a little short by measurement
with the NanoVNA.
I hung it from a fan in the middle
of the room to measure it
without interference.
I lengthened it at the far bend
by soldering some extra house wire
in the bend.

Now it looks perfect for 2m and 70cm.
