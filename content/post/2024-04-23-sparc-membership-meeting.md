### Joined the Club
My membership was [approved](https://k3ir.org/2024/04/23/sparc-meeting-minutes-2024-04-23/), 
so [SPARC](https://k3ir.org/) now has 146 members.
Mark asked if I'm a climber. 
It sounds like lots of people chicken out
about half way up when
climbing the tower.
When studying
for my license,
I didn't commit
a lot of the tower stuff
to memory,
since I didn't expect 
to be involved 
in that sort of thing.

### Ham Fest in York
SPARC will be 
at the [Ham Fest in York](https://www.yorkhamfest.org/)
with some "ham junk" for sale.
Ralph, from Radio Shack, 
bought Souders' small hardware business,
so he'll have all those small accessories there.
Testing will be available
at the Ham Fest on a walk-in basis.

### Other Programs and Notes

  at City Star Diner.

  Maybe on Mondays.

  - I'm never going to finish my podcast list.

  I need to look 
  into his [POTA activations](https://pota.app/#/profile/KC3QEH).
