I've installed the 
[NUNU](https://github.com/kamilsss655/uv-k5-firmware-custom)
fork of the egzumer firmware
on the uv-k6.
It has a cool channel spectrum analyzer for super-fast scanning
that can see all the active channels at once in the graph.
There's no good way to _proceed_ to the next channel,
but that's not a huge problem.

The firmware also includes some unneeded "NUNU" mesh messaging protocol.
