### My Week in Ham Radio
- Chuck's repairs sound fascinating
  - enough basic electronics from childhood to get to general
- HF radio
  - QRP X6100 with 3rd party firmware - R1CBU
  - Maintainer is flaming out
    - ungrateful complaints
    - unhelpful bug reports
  - Source code is available, so some of us may pick it up
  - UI is an app running on a small embedded linux computer
- Flashed new firmware onto my Quansheng UV-K5 HT
- Restrung a random wire
  - From a steep sloper into a tree in front yard
    to flat horizontal to the shed in the backyard.
  - Patterns in FT8 contacts look a little different
- Learning CW
  - Morse machine
  - All 40 characters they quiz: Koch method
  - Try the feel with a 3d-printed iambic key
  - Next try a different character set: cwops
  - Next more traditional copying exercises

### Question
- Often rebuilding and testing antennas
  - On HF, I can test with FT8 and pskreporter
  - See effect of my changes and maybe more propagation conditions
  - For VHF, how variable are the conditions?
  - On the fringe of accessing 985.
  - Slight repositions with unintuitive results
  - What conditions affect propagation to a repeater like this one?
  - What can I measure?
- Requirements for the Scout badge in radio?
