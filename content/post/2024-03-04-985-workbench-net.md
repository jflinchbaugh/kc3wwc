### This Week in Ham Radio
- I pulled my j-pole wire 
  into a tree by string for tonight, 
  so it's outside the house.
- Started testing a longer 71-foot (21.65m) EFRW after months 
  of using the shorter 41-foot EFRW.
  - seems mostly the same, so far.
- ARRL Internationl DX SSB Contest
  - First time using SSB on HF
    - Usually digital modes
    - Not a rag-chewer: here to discuss tech
  - 41-ft random wire
  - 10 watts
  - 42 valid contacts in 37 DXCCs
    - Did hit Russia, but then realized I had tuned too low for my privileges
    - Hit lots of other parts of Europe and South America
  - I was Surprised how well SSB worked
  - I might want a vanity url:
    - Shorter: less room for error
    - People don't seem to expect "WW"
    - People misheard 2 -> 3
    - Might be easier to type
  - It was nice to chase, since I could pause, relisten until I got the call, etc.

### Question about Tuning SSB
During the DX contest,
people were tuned all over, 
not just on full khz.
A woman with a higher voice confounded me 
for a moment
as I tried to get her to sound right.
I was tuning by 100hz,
so some were boomy low, 
a bit high-pitched,
and some were just right.
Tuning people a little higher 
made them easier to read,
but that probably makes me lower for them.
I tried to keep them as low as I could understand.
RIT/XIT might have been useful for longer conversations.

What's the best practice tuning SSB to hear clearly and tx as clearly as possible?
