_I failed to check-in do to RF issues,
but my summary is still good._

### My Week in Amateur Radio
- Antenna movement
  - Trying my dipole antennas in new places
    - hanging dipole in back yard
    - still getting debilitating interference over 985
    - 21 and k3ir coming in pretty good
  - Restrung the EFRW antenna for HF
    - a little higher, straighter in the tree
  - It's great fun to throw wires and strings in trees
  <!--more-->
- Overload on UV-K5 with better antennas
  - UV-K5 & UV-K6 for comparison - not broken
  - Balance antenna location good enough but not _too_ good
  - Going to try a bandstop filter, 
    but not sure about transmitting through it
  - Love the firmware options on Quansheng radios,
    but do I need a better radio?
  - It kills me that I'm so marginal
    for accessing my favorite repeaters.
- Modifying params database on xiegu x6100
  - Now shows me accurate bands and privileges,
    so i won't accidentally wander beyond my privileges.
  - Modified the source code 
    and rebuilt the database 
    from my source
- I picked up an Evolve 3 laptop that runs on 12v
  - Getting linux installed on it
- Still learning CW
  - 20wpm
  - It's so difficult to stay focused copying 
    at 20wpm even 
    for 1 minute
