I did a bit of the
[ARRL 10m Contest](https://www.arrl.org/10-meter)
all in CW.
I keyed with my 3D-printed iambic paddle
but relied on the X6100
to decode incoming signals for me.

I made 13 contacts
across 10 states/provinces
in 4 ITU zones.
I used the
[Web2Cabrillo website](https://b4h.net/cabforms/)
to type up my handwritten logs
and produce a Cabrillo file
to submit to the contest.
