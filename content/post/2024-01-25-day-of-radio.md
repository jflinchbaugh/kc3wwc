### ARRL/FCC/ARCC in Harrisburg
KA3TKW and the 21 repeater group 
hosted a lunch with representatives 
from the ARRL, the FCC, and the ARCC.

### POTA
I stopped at State Game Land 246 
near Middletown 
to activate
on 10m FT8/FT4.

I used 2 different antennas:
    - initially used Grabil whip fully extended, shorted coil, w/ tuner
    - 12.5m EFRW thrown into a tree
Both antennas seemed to perform similarly.
I was skipping far: lots of contacts came 
from Oregon, Washington, and I even got Alaska.

### Clipperton DX
Later that day, 
I also contacted the Clipperton DX station, TX5S,
on 40m via FT8
