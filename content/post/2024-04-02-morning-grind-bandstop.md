I checked into the Morning Grind 
on K3IR today.
The questions was: plans for solar eclipse?
I transmitted successfully 
through the [FM bandstop filter](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-com-broadcast-fm-band-stop-filter-88-108-mhz-reject-now-for-sale/) 
from rtl-sdr.com.
The filter has helped immensely 
to hold 2m signals
with sensitive external antenna.
