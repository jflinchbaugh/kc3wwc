I encountered a
[bug using the ATU](https://github.com/gdyuldin/x6100_gui/issues/134)
on R1CBU 0.29.2.
I had lots of tunings very near each other,
so it switched a lot.
It queries and uses the nearest tuning to current frequency,
so lots of close tunings will cause thrashing as you move.
I cleared the `atu` table in `params.db`
to alleviate the problem for a bit.
