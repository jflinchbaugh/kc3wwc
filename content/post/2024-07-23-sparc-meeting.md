At the previous week's meeting,
many people built EFHW kits
and untangled some wire
to use with them.
No one finished the build
and brought them back,
so I offered a quick demo
of tuning such an antenna.

I connected my 49:1 unun
that I've been using
to a new wire we had
hanging.
We connected
a handful of different analyzers
to see how they operated.
