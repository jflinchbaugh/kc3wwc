I followed calculations and instructions to build a 
[quarter-wave ground plane antenna](https://m0ukd.com/calculators/quarter-wave-ground-plane-antenna-calculator/)
from some wire and a UHF connector 
that I picked up
at the last Ham Fest
in Harrisburg.
I cut everything a little long
and soldered it together.
I trimmed the radials to about 54-inches
and folded and rolled
the radiator wire
to a length that is resonant at 147MHz.
I measured with the NanoVNA.
Once it was at the right frequency,
I found that bending the radials
up and down could adjust the SWR
at its lowest point on the graph.
Keeping the radials slightly flatter 
had a lower SWR
than the 45 degrees suggested in the original design.

This ground plane antenna feeds from the bottom,
which is physically more sound
than the vertical dipole 
I had up previously.
I tested it last night
when I strung it up,
and it reaches Harrisburg 
and Parkesburg with no problem.
