I got in W1JMA's log
when they were activating [US-7545](https://pota.app/#/park/US-7545).
on 7047.5kHz.
They looked me up in QRZ, so knew my name and location.
I sent _599_ and received _599_.
It was a super-minimal exchange, because I fumbled a lot.

I had to read a bit about how to correct errors,
and I soon stumbled into AF3Z on 7036kHz,
and I saw a funny series of attempted corrections:
"a littr eee a littr eee a bit"

Later, I Got a second contact, KV4UD.
