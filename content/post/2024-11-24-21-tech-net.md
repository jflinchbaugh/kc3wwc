### My Weeks in Radio
- QRP on a couple hawaiian islands
- not much 2m activity
  - added some repeaters and scanned
- POTA
  - Xiegu x6100 mostly turned up to 8W
  - mostly 10m-30m and everything in between
  - challenging to be on an island where you have to go thousands of miles
    or you reach no one.
  - antennas:
    - 40M EFHW where I had room,
    - 41ft long EFRW with less room
    - vertical whip and coil attached to a fishing pole for a less conspicuous setup
      on some beaches
  - 6 parks and 2 trails on 2 islands:
    - sandy beaches
    - rocky lava fields
    - inside diamondhead caldera
    - atop steaming kilauea
  - reached:
    - west: Australia, New zealand, Fiji, Japan, Russia, China,
      South Cook Islands, Samoa
    - east: North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Dominican Republic, Argentina
  - practiced some CW on the beach when I didn't get out the computer
- back to a home park yesterday, but the weather was not as nice.
- took down my home-made 2m antennas and straightened them up.
- trying F4HWN 3.7 firmware for Quansheng radios
  - from a scanner-centered AUBSUK firmware that was skipping some channels
- looking forward to that ft challenge contest
