At [US-1418, Sam Lewis](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1418),
I tried setting up down near the low playground
on the corner near the road.
There were no trees with good spots.
All the viable branches were very high,
and I couldn't quite get a line over them.

I resorted to an inverted-v supported by fishing pole
in the middle at 9ft or so.
I operated mostly FT8 on 15m, 20m, and 40m,
and I did a little SSB on 40m.
I got Canada, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, etc.
