This weekend was the
[FT Challenge](https://www.rttycontesting.com/ft-challenge/).

I made about 112 contacts
over 14 unique "letter grids".
I operated QRP (<5W), single operator, single radio.
We scored points for each contact
plus each 3000km distance on a contact,
and the multiplier was that number
of unique letter grids.
I uploaded my logs,
and it'll probably be a while
until I see an official score,
but I figure I probably got about 2000 points.
