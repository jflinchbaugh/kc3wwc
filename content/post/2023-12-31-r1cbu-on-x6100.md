I've loaded the [R1CBU](https://r1cbu.ru/index.php/) UI 
on the X6100.
Reading the manual exposes all sorts of great features and conveniences:

### Highlights
- Large waterfall
- Lots of options on MFK and VOL knobs, and it's customizable
- SWR scan is very fast
- CW decoder is robust
- ALC starts at 0.0
- Serial console access: `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`, root, 123

### Bugs
- Setting time down to the second is weird.
  I used serial console and CLI instead.
