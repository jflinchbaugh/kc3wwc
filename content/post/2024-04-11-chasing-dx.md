On the good old 12.5m EFRW,
I'm trying 10m FT8 this morning. 
It's going _nowhere_.
15m is much better.

### Chasing Hawaii

I have [ham-alert](https://hamalert.org/about) 
for anyone in PA, NJ, or MD 
spotting the Hawaii DXCC.
I've been chasing Hawaii 
around over to 17m and other bands 
as they pop up,
but I didn't seem them much.
It's the last state I need 
of the 50.

10m is busy here in mid-afternoon, 
and I'm reaching south america on 5w.
I got Suriname and Cayman Islands on 5w.
then 10m maybe died again.

### Pitcairn Island DXpedition

I just got the 
[VP6G DXpedetion](https://www.qrz.com/db/VP6G)
on 5w 
on FT8 on 28.0785MHz. 
That's my first "OC"!
I don't know why they were shifted,
but I saw it on the waterfall on my X6100,
so checked it out.
