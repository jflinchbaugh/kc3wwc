I setup camp at Marietta Riverfront Park
with the EFHW stretched
from the pavilion to the nearby tree.
I was expecting to get rained out,
but it never came.

I got 23 FT8 contacts on 20m
and 3 SSB contacts on 40m and 20m at 10W.
I also spoke to a nuclear ship in Baltimore,
and I heard some light house special event stations.
It was so quiet there at the park
compared to my desk full of computers
that I thought the NR was stuck on.

W3FIS, Dr Paul Ross,
stopped by to activate,
so we chatted a while
after nearly 25 years
since I was in college..
