I used the [N3KZ repeater system](https://www.n3kz.com/),
specifically the York node on 442.050,
for the first time from home.
I spoke to N3RCI, who I usually hear on KX3B.
He was on the node in Havre de Grace.
I used the 1/4-wave ground plane antenna in the tree.

I continue to be amazed that a 70cm repeater node
has such reach.
I used the York node,
but I often hear the nodes in Cumberland, York, and Lebanon;
sometimes I even hear Chambersburg...on UHF.
It just doesn't seem like it should be possible.
