### 985 Breakfast

It was good to chat radio with everyone,
and Luke talked about restoring his antique loose coupler radio.

### US-1380 Marsh Creek

After breakfast, Vic KC3TYX, and I made our way
to [US-1380 Marsh Creek](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1380)
for a park activation
and to compare notes on how we operate.

The weather was pleasant,
and Vic started on 20m with a vertical ham stick
and faraday cloth for a ground plane.

I tossed a EFHW to slope from the picnic table up into a tree.
I got it in a good spot with the first try.
I was on 40m to give him some room,
but the band was pretty dead
in the middle of the day.
I still had a little interference, since Vic was running 100W.
I eventually switched to 20m when Vic had enough contacts,
so I could finish my activation.
Only 15m and 20m really worked for much.
I did all digital + 1 phone to another park in Tennessee.
