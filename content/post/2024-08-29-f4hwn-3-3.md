I loaded [F4HWN](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom-feat-F4HWN)
3.3 onto my UV-K5
to have a look.
It only has 3 scan lists,
and it's awkward to cycle through them.
I found starting the spectrum analyzer to be cumbersome as well,
since i couldn't attach it to a long-press of a button.
The single VFO view is pretty nice;
it puts lots of nice info on the screen,
and it's big.
Ultimately, I went right back to AubsUK
for the scan features.
