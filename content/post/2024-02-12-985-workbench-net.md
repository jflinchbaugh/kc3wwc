### My Week in Ham Radio
- CQ WPX RTTY contest
  - Chased 41 contacts
  - Called CQ with no responses
- Played in the front yard getting my existing random wire
  a little higher in the tree
- Running around 20 minutes before this meeting to try to get my 2m antenna
  in a place that makes sense. I failed, so I'm on EchoLink.

### Others' Questions
- Number codes? 73, 72 best regards in QRP.
- Recapping equipment
  - Check temperature ratings of capacitors 85C vs 105C
  - Keeping voltage applied regularly keeps a capacitor
    in good function
  - Try to operate capacitors nearer to their V rating
    to keep them "formed up"
  - Is anything leaking from the bottom of the caps
  - Signs of problems?
