### My Week in Ham Radio

- Built and deployed a 1/4 wave ground plane with radials
  - wire soldered to an UHF chassis plug
  - fed from the bottom
  - hung in a tree by cord
- York Hamfest and 2 parks out that way
  - Codorus
  - Sam Lewis
  - EFRW
  - Mostly ft8
  - 40m hot at 5:30pm
  - 2 phone contacts in Canadian parks for park-to-park QSO
  - Took some time to experiment a little
  - Fishing pole mast with 3D-printed fork 
    on the end to catch the wire
  - Stop pulling on coax...loosened ends
- SPDX RTTY contest (Poland)
  - 2 contacts
  - ended at noon UTC on sunday, so ran out of time
- AubsUK firmware for Quansheng
  - 10 scanlists
  - automatic scan on power-up, feature request
- Picked up a new podcast: 
  [Ham Radio Workbench](https://www.hamradioworkbench.com/)
- [Simplex Net](https://simplexradio.net/):
  heard 16 of the 38 people
### My Questions
- with nicer weather and time to experiment with antennas,
  how would you recommend iterating and experimenting?
  I have:
  - the QRP transceiver
  - digital modes & pskreporter
  - nanovna
  - some modeling software I could learn
  - the latest [ARRL Antenna Book](https://www.arrl.org/arrl-antenna-book)
### Discussion
- Dipoles, sloped or flat?
  - Flat leaves nulls toward the ends
  - Sloped fills it in to be a bit more omnidirectional
  - An antenna close to the ground is going to be NVIS
  - Vertical is omnidirectional
- Ron's seeing infinite SWR on the "screwdriver" antenna.
  - Others have had problems as well.
- Mike wonders about viability of using 6m FM in his area
- My Question:
  How should I evaluate and structure
  my experiments with antennas?
  - Conditions change constantly
  - Learn to read solar data
  - Take notes on conditions and try to test in similar conditions
  - Vic's experiments:
    - endfeds
    - hamsticks
    - radials
    - aluminum screen or faraday cloth for ground plane
  - WSPRnet and pskreporter help gauge how you're getting out
  - See what you can hear
  - Qualify callsign for different tests, so I can tell them apart
    in pskreporter: `kc3wwc/a`, `kc3wwc/b`, etc
- Ken wonders about TNC for packet radio on HF/VHF
  - Glenn, N3MEL would be the person to contact
- We heard lots of interference and doubling in the beginning of the net
  - This was likely another manifestation of intermod
  - Tropospheric ducting happens more in morning in the summer
