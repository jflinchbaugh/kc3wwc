### My Weeks in Radio
- QRP on a couple Hawaiian islands
- Not much 2m activity on the islands
  - added some repeaters and scanned
- POTA
  - no summits
  - all successful activations via FT8/FT4
    - allowed me to use pskreporter to study my propagation
      on different bands, even if other stations didn't answer my call
  - practiced some CW on the beach when I didn't get out the computer
  - mostly turned up to 8W
  - mostly 10m-30m and everything in between
  - challenging to be on an island where you have to go thousands of miles
    or you reach no one.
  - 6 parks and 2 trails on 2 islands:
    - inside Diamondhead caldera
    - atop steaming Kilauea
    - rocky lava fields
    - sandy beaches
  - reached:
    - west: Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Japan, Russia, China,
      South Cook Islands, Samoa
    - east: North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Dominican Republic, Argentina
  - antennas:
    - 40M EFHW where I had room,
    - 21.5M-long EFRW with less room
    - vertical whip and coil attached to a fishing pole
      for a less conspicuous setup
      on some beaches
- It may be time to start cobbling together an allstar node.

### Others
- W3JAM, Jeff: Jerry Sevic (w2fmi) books on transformers and baluns
- KC3TMZ, Matt:
  - Lives in a park
  - Built a dipole and analyzed it
    - really good SWR: 1.048:1
    - 20 ft into the tree
    - reached California on 20m
    - ran into ARRL Sweepstakes
    - dipole in a tree is a lot of work
    - playing with Inovato Hamclock
- WA3VEE, Ron:
  - worked ARRL Sweepstakes a bit
  - cleared the bench
  - may have gear to sell soon
- KB3ZIM, Bob:
  - avoided ARRL Sweepstakes
  - enjoying 10m
  - some 10m AM as well

    - lost settings and had to setup again
- W3QP, Tim:
  - found the 4th edition of the balun book on archive.org
  - winding 2 wires around the toroid is a lot like winding coax
  - winding 4 wires in opposite directions will give more bandwidtch
- NA3CW, Chuck:
  - learned lots from W2FMI book
    - W2FMI tested everything extensively
  - got Steve's antenna in the air...through the vines, thorns, etc
  - normal nets, including PMA AM net.
  - working on an ultimate transmatch tuner
- KC3OOK, Bill:

  - showed wife around 10m tech area
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - built a Hartley transmitter for 1929 AMA event
    - 1 tube
    - 1-2W
    - worked 5 stations over 80 minutes
- KV3JGB, Matt:

  - launched an antenna with help from 985-ers after breakfast
  - starting cwops
- W3MFB, Mike:
  - just chatting locally on the radio

### Questions
- KC3TMZ, Matt:
  - setting up shack in the garage, and ordered a hamclock.
    wifi is a bit weak. can he extend with a yagi?
    - W3CRW, CR:
      - years ago, had a yagi antenna for wifi, and it worked
      - wifi extender/repeater does even better
    - W3DIB, Greg:
      - trench fiber instead of cat5/6.
        - isolated from electrical storms
      - if you don't need a ton of bandwidth,
        try wifi halow bridge on 900mhz.
        - 4Mb
      - yagi antenna may pull in noise from others
    - KB3ZIM, Bob: Adam, KB3ZUV, another 985-er, is working on a similar project
  - flying with HTs?
    - WA3VEE, Ron:
      - bring a good copy of your license printed from cores
      - batteries must be carried on, not checked
    - KB3ZIM, Bob:
      - batteries are the concern
      - check size with the airline
    - KC3WWC, John:
      - wonderous bag of radio gear
        - HT
        - 10Ah lifepo4
        - QRP radio
        - antenna wires
        - if you check any gear, separate out the batteries to carry
    - WA3VEE, Ron:
      - sent link to website
      - limit 8wh, do the math.
      - precheck helps smooth the screening
    - W8CRW, CR:
      - CR has more trouble with carrying powertools since they're not marked
        than HT
- KB3ZIM, Bob:
  - wants to get a wire for 160M in the air.
  - could be a long wire with a tuner
  - what's a good length for a random wire
  - W3QP, Tim: lots of tables out there
  - KC3WWC: google "udel random wire"
    - always choke and counterpoise to avoid common mode current
  - KB3ZIM, Bob:
    - google "ham radio secrets"
      - talks about tuning the counterpoise
    - could try a super-slinky
- W3DIB, Greg:
  - recently got on RF instead of
  - has anyone reverse-engineered the serial connections
    for Yaesu
  - W3QP, Tim: could use wireshark to look at serial traffic through usb
    serial adapter
  - KC3WWC, John: there's cat and drivers for everything
  - W3DIB, Greg: this is a lesser radio without cat control,
    so he's looking to control all the comms himself
