I had a bit of bad coax
on the [most recent POTA](/post/2024-12-28-pota-us-9719/),
so I set out to test and repair it.
I saw no damage to the cable or connectors,
but there wasn't continuity across the middle wire.

Which end is likely bad?
I connected each end to the nanovna with a Smith Chart.
I found on one end, the smith chart traced a spiral
around the outside of the circle.
The other side did not react at all,
like I hadn't connected anything.
For comparison,
I tried another cable I figured was good.
That other cable had continuity to each end,
and both ends each traced a spiral on the smith chart.
The length of the spiral seemed to be related directly
to the length of the coax:
shorter traced shorter
and longer traced longer.

So with that,
I replaced the one end that didn't react,
and now the cable looks good.
