**Update (2024-07-17):**
It turns out,
the noise I heard interfering most
with the Monday Night 985 Workbench Net
was another net on a repeater
in the opposite direction
and 15khz off the 985 frequency.
That signal started up 
at the same time
as the 985 net
and overwhelmed my radios.
The filter helped a little,
but not really,
it seems.
I eventually resorted
to a directional antenna
for real improvement.
I'm fortunate the repeaters are
in opposite directions.
