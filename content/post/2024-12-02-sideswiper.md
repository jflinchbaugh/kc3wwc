KN3I, John,
and AF3Z, Jim,
were talking on 985
about [Sideswiper keys](https://www.f5swn.fr/en/?Telegraphy/The-Sideswiper).
Technically, it's a straight key.
It's 2 straight keys together,
so it's not considered an automatic keyer.
You can optionally use
either key to manually key a dit or a dah.
Sideswiper is sometimes called a Cootie Key.
It sounds interesting,
since it'll not race me on dits.
