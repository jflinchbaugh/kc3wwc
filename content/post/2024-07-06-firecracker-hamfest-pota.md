### Firecracker Hamfest
Matt and I wandered around and talked to some people.
I only bought a few small things:
- tiny efhw kit.
- nice 65W PD 20Ah power brick.
- broken kenwood HT, won't power on, but charges. (took a chance, but no plan.)

### US-4356, Boyd Big Tree Preserve
- EFHW from pavilion, across side trail entrance, into a tree.
- Rough time with SSB to start.
  I couldn't be heard.
  I'd stalk these multi-operator activators
  for 10 minutes,
  prepare my logs,
  and then not be able to contact them.
- Operated all FT8 on 40m.
- One SSB P2P at the end.
- It was very hot.

While operating,
I got an email
from a contact,
so I sent a photo
and explained
my setup with WSJT-X
and the x6100.
