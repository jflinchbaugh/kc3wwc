I visited the K3IR tower site
for their _Elmer Night_.
People were configuring cameras;
testing an ultra-portable FT8 setup:
- truSDX radio
- ft8cn on a phone
- very lightweight wire antenna and transformer kit
- an inexpensive, but super-long, fishing pole as a mast

(Now I need one of those fishing poles.)

I borrowed a soldering iron 
and started on my own project:
assembling a couple common mode chokes
from a short piece of RG174.
It got dark quick, 
so I finished the chokes at home.
It was my first time trying
to crimp those SMA connectors.

I got a quick tour
of all the repeater hardware.
There are a lot more services
running on these towers than I realized.
