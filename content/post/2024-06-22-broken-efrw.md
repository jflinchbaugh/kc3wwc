My 12.5m EFRW at home broke again,
so I needed to restring it.
The wire breaks at the tie point up in the tree.
The kids and I failed to launch it again over the tree
with slingshot out the window.
I had also tried some small 3d-printed
[s-biner clips](https://www.printables.com/model/402834-s-clip-s-biner),
but they'd release as soon as I launched with the slingshot
I got the wire running flat
_through_ the other tree instead of up and over.

That didn't last too long.
The wire broke again at the tie point,
so I launched it from the street again
with the throw line and sockets.
I kept it a little looser
and switched to a bungee cord
to keep it tensioned
with some play.
