I drove out to West Chester yesterday,
but I've not bothered looking up
and adding repeaters for the area.
Instead, I could set the spectrum analyzer
on the UV-K6 (or K5)
to scan the 145MHz-148MHz,
stepping on 5.00kHz,
and I had a pretty good picture
of any repeaters to hear out there.

Once I heard something,
I could pop open RepeaterBook
on my phone and see what it was,
but it saved me lots of trouble
programming anything into the radio
ahead of time to not necessarily need it.
