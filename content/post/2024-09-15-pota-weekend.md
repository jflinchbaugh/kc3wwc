I used the EFHW for everything.
I activated 4 park entities:
- [Caledonia State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1337)
  after riding the Michaux GRVL ride.
- [Michaux State Forest](https://pota.app/#/park/US-5471)
  from the ATV trail parking on the ridge.
- [Kings Gap Environmental Education Center](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4361)
  late in the day, so I raced a little.
  - antenna up in about 8 minutes
  - 10 contacts within 26 minutes
  - on the road again 14 minutes later
- [Pine Grove Furnace](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1398)
  the next morning,
  where I ran out of battery,
  so I did the whole thing with 1W FT8.
  I practiced a bit and started putting out my call on CW
  to see if RBN would pick me up,
  but kept it to a shy 1W.
  It didn't pick me up.
