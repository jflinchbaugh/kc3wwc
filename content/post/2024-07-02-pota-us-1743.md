Matt and I activated
[POTA US-1743, White Clay Creek, DE](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1743).
I deployed the 20m-long EFHW into a tree,
which worked nicely with no SWR.
Matt deployed a telescoping dipole
on a mast.
I worked only 40m,
and Matt ran 20m.
We didn't interfere with each other at all.
I forgot my 5525 power splitter
to run both the laptop and radio off 12V battery,
but fortunately I didn't need it
for the computer.
