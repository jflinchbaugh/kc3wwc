I took the Amtrak from Lancaster to Pittsburgh
to visit Marie.
In down times, 
I scanned with the spectrum analyzer 
on my UV-K5.

### Rail
On the train, I scanned the 
[rail frequencies](https://www.radioreference.com/db/aid/7747),
159MHz-162MHz.
I could hear some chatter
about the Norfolk Southern freight trains
in our way,
and I heard the automated messages reporting
clear track conditions.

### CMU Buggy Net

Scanning the entire 2m band
on Saturday morning,
I heard the radio club kids
running their regular net 
that supports [buggy practices](http://www.w3vc.org/buggy.html).
