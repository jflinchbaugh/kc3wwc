The quarter-wave ground plane antenna
in the tree
disconnected in the wind,
so I brought it back down
and rebuilt it stronger
with radials passing through the holes
and woven together.
I used randomly shorter radials,
but 8 of them this time.
I watched the SWR drop with the nanoVNA
as I added radials.
I resoldered the driven element
into the socket
and trimmed it to tune it again.
