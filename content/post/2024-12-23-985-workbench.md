### My Week in Radio
- Walked down the 35-foot flagpole to do some antenna maintenance in the cold
- Hunting a handful of CW POTA contacts
- Waiting for a good snow day to curl up
  with the AllStar manual and ARRL antenna book
- Thinking about my path through ham radio and focus on digital modes and CW,
  not spending much time with SSB
- ISS will be transmitting SSTV on 145.800MHz, 25 December - 5 Januaary

### Others
- KC3SCY, Luke:
  - On 10m, not so busy this past week
  - Working crystal set
- K3FHA, John:
  - Fixing up and using an antique radio
- KC3TYX, Vic:
  - Diagnosing/repairing a fan problem in a power supply
- NA3CW, Chuck:
  - 2M rig in car would shutoff during TX
    - PL259 connector was loose
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - Working 10m
  - Working a couple CW contacts: Europe, etc.
  - Organizing the shack: radio, photography, etc
- KV3JGB, Matt:
  - Fighting with a tree to get an antenna mounted
- KC3SQI, Wayne:
  - Talking to Los Angeles then Greenland
  - Propagation shifts
- W3DIB, Greg:
  - Reverse-engineering the serial protocol of a Yaesu radio

### Questions
- W8CRW, CR: From the news, how would one use WSPR to find a downed airplane?
  - WA3VEE, Ron: they could be searching for the weak beacon on 121MHz
  - KC3SQI, Wayne: May have been looking at WSPR logs to look
    at reflected signals between stations.

- AF3Z, Jim:
  - What is it about WSPR that makes people think they can use it
    to search for anomolies?
    - KC3WWC, John:
      - WSPR is used to test propagation and reach.
        you send signals for a few minutes, and others report back
        through a central database without needing to have a conversation
        or to be even able to get a signal back the other way.
      - There's a huge volume of data that was collected centrally
        as the plane traveled.
- AF3Z, Jim:
  - Recounted his understanding of fuses and how they fail according
    to voltage rating.
  - NA3CW, Chuck: Failure means they can explode.
  - KC3SQI, Wayne:
    - Father saw huge 4-foot-long industrial fuses explode
      after lightning strike.
