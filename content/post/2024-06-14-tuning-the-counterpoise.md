My antenna wires at the house
were getting moved around a bit
with some projects.
I found my SWR was a bit high
on a certain HF band,
and I found moving
or coiling the counterpoise (~5.2M)
to shorten it
greatly reduced SWR.
I have to remember
to watch performance
and adjust the counterpoise
as part of my setup and operating.
