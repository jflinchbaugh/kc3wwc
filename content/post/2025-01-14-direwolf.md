I had to decompressed `/usr/share/doc/direwolf/conf/direwolf.conf.gz`
to `$HOME/direwolf.conf`,
so I could get Direwolf running.
I customized the configuration file:
- set my callsign
- listed audio devices with `arecord -L`,
  found `pipewire`, and set `ADEVICE pipewire` in the config
- plugged the Btech APRS cable into the Quansheng and computer
- Direwolf is decoding packet (from 145.010MHz)
  and APRS (144.390MHz).
- `-q d` quiets APRS decode errors when reading plain packet
- `-t 0` disables the colors
- with `pipewire`, I can have both my `record-aprs.sh` script
  and Direwolf decoding.
- decoded APRS from ISS on 144.825MHz via `multimon-ng`:
