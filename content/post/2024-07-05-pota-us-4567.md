[US-4567, Capt John Smith Chesapeake Trail](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4567)
stretches from New York to the Chesapeake Bay
following the Susquehanna River,
so that means we can activate from any public land
within 100ft of the river.
I drove from Turkey Hill to Bainbridge evaluating spots along the river:
- Riverfront park in Columbia would be nice
- The boat launch on south side of Marietta has a nice bit of beach.
- The park on the north side of Marietta is a bit too busy,
  but did have a nice area of grass and trees.
- I setup at the Riverfront park in Bainbridge.

I threw the EFHW
into an inverted-V
in tree and back down to a bench.
I worked SSB first
for some park-to-park activations,
and then switched to FT8 on 40m.
