### This Week in Ham Radio
- [RTTY NA Sprint](https://ncjweb.com/north-american-sprint/)
- The 2m dipole is flopping around outside on this windy day.
- I heard the ISS pass on scan. That's always pretty cool.
- I checked into the [Simplex Net in Lancaster County](https://simplexradio.net/)
  I reached the West check-in to Mount Joy with my external antenna
  and my Quansheng UV-K5 running 5W.
