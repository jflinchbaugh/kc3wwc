I'm listening to the April Tower Drill 
of [Lancaster ARES](https://www.lancasterares.net/).
They seem to be roving around the county
and contacting each of the repeaters
to log a signal report 
at higher and lower power levels,
especially down to HTs.
  
From the ARES page, 
I discovered a new repeater 
to add to my scan list: 
[W3AD](https://lrts.org/) at
`145.39 PL 118.8`.
