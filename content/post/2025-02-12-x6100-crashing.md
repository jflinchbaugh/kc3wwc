My X6100 started freezing up its user-interface.
This happens sometimes when the radio board shuts off,
but the UI board hasn't yet.
It would happen when I was transmitting,
even very low power, 2W.
It even did it after a long time just listening.

I unplugging the USB-C from the computer,
and it would allow the UI to shutdown,
so the USB-C was powering the UI board,
while the radio board had shutdown.
The internal battery indicator looked like it
may have shown low for a moment,
but I was on 12V.

I finally realized I had enabled battery charging all the time.
Charging the mostly-worn-out battery caused this new shutdown problem.
I disabled charging, and now the radio is running fine again.

I ordered 2 new internal battery packs
from Amazon to install.
I used to be able to run the radio
on internal battery for a little while,
but now as soon as I unplug external power,
the battery will read something terribly low like 7% and about 6 volts.
