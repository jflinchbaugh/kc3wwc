We headed to [Caledonia State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1337)
for the Arts & Craft Fair for a couple hours.
I threw the 12.5m EFRW
into a nearby tree.
40m was dead.
20m and 15m were very busy
with SSB contesters
for the [IARU HF World Championship](https://www.arrl.org/iaru-hf-world-championship)
Via FT8 and SSB,
I could hear lots of EU on 15m, 17m, and 20m,
but not much in local signals.
Not many people were hearing me,
so I only made 4 contacts in the hour or so
that I tried.
