### US-1356 Pinchot

I setup at a pavillion
far away from everyone else,
so as not to burden anyone wondering what I was doing.
Putting up the 20m-long EFHW,
I got the socket and throw line
stuck in a tree.
I had to cut it loose.

I tried 10m for 2 FT8 contacts,
but that's all the further I could stretch that band.
The rest of my contacts came on FT8 40m,
and one P2P SSB contact on 40m before I packed up.

### US-1418 Sam Lewis

At the second park,
I operated mostly 20m with the GRA-1900 coil and whip.
I was struggling to get that to the right settings,
so I finally just extended it
and hit the tuner on the radio.

I accidentally crossed the 0000UTC mark into the next day,
which means it's a new activation.
I scrambled to try to complete the new day,
but fell short.
