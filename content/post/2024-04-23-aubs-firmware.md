I'm trying out the 
[Aubs 00.07](https://github.com/AubsUK/uv-k5-firmware-custom)
firmware on my Quansheng radios.
It's based on the latest egzumer, 
and so far has kept up-to-date,
and it has its own plugin for Chirp.

It has some really cool features for scanning:
- scan on start, 
  a feature I requested of egzumer, 
  but was denied by egzumer.
- 10 scan lists.
  I organized mine as:
  - 1 = local repeaters and popular simplex
  - 2 = all simplex, Ham and GMRS
  - 3 = non-local repeaters and other listening
  - 4 = satellites
- press `*` to lockout a frequency from scan.
- fast scan like egzumer
- frequency spectrum analyzer, but no memory spectrum analyzer like nunu.

This is my daily driver now on both my radios.
