I connected up to Winlink
through
[N3FYI's gateway on 144.950MHz](https://www.n3fyi.com/?page_id=573).
using 1/4-wave antenna hanging
in the tree.
I also had set my APRS message to "Winlink",
so the Winlink server pinged me
over APRS when I had a message.
I'm not sure I could read the APRS message
on the UV-PRO, though,
since I let it sit too long.
I had a message icon,
but I couldn't dismiss it.
