I had followed the
[these nice directions](https://vk6ysf.com/balun_4-1.htm)
to build my 4:1 unun
to use with a Rybakov and Tactical Delta Loop,
but I made a mistake:
- the wires that come from the shield continue in opposite directions
  around the toroid
- on my bad build, they originally both went the same way side by side.
- the diagram is clear, if you look closely,
  but the picture is even clearer.
