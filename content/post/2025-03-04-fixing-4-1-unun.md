I had followed the
[these nice directions](https://vk6ysf.com/balun_4-1.htm)
to build my 4:1 unun
to use with a Rybakov and Tactical Delta Loop,
but I made a mistake:
- the wires that come from the shield continue in opposite directions
  around the toroid
- on my bad build, they originally both went the same way side by side.
- the diagram is clear, if you look closely,
  but the picture is even clearer.

I tested the 4:1
with the tactical delta loop.
It consists of:
- the 4:1 unun.
- 2 17-ft telescoping whips up diagonally 90 degrees from each other.
- 25-ft wire connecting the ends of the whips with alligator clips.
- 3d-printed plastic mount to hold it all at the bottom.
- screwdriver stuck through the mount into the ground to hold it up.
- alligator clips to connect the unun to each side of the loop.
- ground spike (screwdriver) wired to the ground side of the loop/unun.
- tuner is required to work 40M-6M. 80M and 160M didn't want to tune.
