I've started installing antennas
at the new house.
I have a 71-foot EFRW out the backyard.
Noise was a bit low, S2 or so.
We'll see how it looks when computers get here.
That wire seems good for 80m.

I strung a 2m/70cm dipole into a tree
in the front yard.
I'm in a bit of a hole, so I'm missing W3GMS,
but K3IR, KA3TKW, AA3RG, W3UU are coming in strong.
