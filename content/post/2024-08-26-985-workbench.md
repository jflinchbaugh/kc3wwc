### My Week in Radio
- The photos looked great from Bill's, KC3OOK, antenna party
- https://ft8.live/ for a more responsive visualization of pskreporter data.
- POTA at Susquehannock
  - No digital, only sideband
  - QSO parties for Hawaii, Kansas, and Ohio
  - Bothered someone with a bit of CW badly
- Morse Machine app on Android for practicing
- I finally confirmed 50 states on QRZ.com with Hawaii
  - generally 5-10W
  - mostly digital, some sideband
- I started playing with a couple Meshtastic nodes
  - Impressive range for low power, ~125mW

*** Questions
- W8CRW, CR: Is there any device that would log a date-time every time you key
  your VHF/UHF transmitter?
  - W3DIB: string together an arduino, some AI, and voice recognition
  - WA3VEE: pull it from broadcastify
  - K3VIL: newer ICOM has a recording feature
  - NA3CW: security system that can log contacts opening/closing
  - W8CRW: looking for something radio agnostic
- KC3OOK, Bill: Balanced-L vs T-Match network tuner for open wire feed.
  Is one better than the other?
  - Balanced L = L-C-L and it's fed on the low-impedance side.
  - T-Match has a wider range, but maybe less efficient.
