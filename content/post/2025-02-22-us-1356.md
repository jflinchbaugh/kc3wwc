I visited
[Gifford Pinchot State Part, US-1356](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1356),
and strung up the EFHW
from a picnic table to a tree.
I managed it in 1 throw to a nice spot.
I made 20 contacts:
- 18 FT8
- 2 CW, including N4T, the Dry Tortugas DXpedition

Using R1CBU 0.29.1,
I knew to pay special attention
to undo the
[AM bug from SWR Scan](https://github.com/gdyuldin/x6100_gui/issues/107)
by switching through modes after an SWR Scan.
In this firmware, though,
WSJTX would set digital mode (USB-D)
and it would bounce back to USB,
which doesn't take sound from the connection to the computer.
I had to work around it by disabling WSJTX's ability to set the mode.
Then I could set USB-D and it would stay there.
