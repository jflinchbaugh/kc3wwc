### My Week in Radio

- I'll miss field day.
- POTA around Harrisburg, York, and Lancaster.
  - Mostly FT8/FT4
  - Also have been chase some phone park-to-park,
    and have been getting good reports with my little QRP radio
  - Exclusively testing the 20m-long EFHW I built.
- Upgrading firmware from a 3rd party for my x6100,
  and my own patch to show me band boundaries by privilege
- Moved the 1/4 wave ground-plane antenna higher in the tree.
- Always get perplexing interference at start of this net,
  otherwise clear all day.
  It's a net on the big repeater over in York that's 15khz lower.
  Maybe I need to build a yagi next, so I can get more directional.

### Other Discussion
- Vic (KC3TYX) was making contacts with VARAC, not for winlink.
  The software let's you beacon on 14.105MHz, and has 15 slots (channels)
  near the calling frequencies for conversation.
  Fire a beacon or 2, and check pskreporter to see if anyone's listening.
- Lots of digital modes have conventional calling frequencies.
- WB8NUT website has sounds of digital modes. http://wb8nut.com/digital/
- Jim (AF3Z) suggests a 5khz shift
  to help alleviate interference
  from W3HZU's net on 145.970,
  so I redefined 985 as 146.990MHz with a -605MHz offset.
  That works in a test after the net.
- Trying to move things around in the radio
  blew away the offset and PL when I saved the new 990 frequency.
  The computer works better or that programming.
