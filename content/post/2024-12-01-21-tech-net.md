### My Week in Radio
- I used N3KZ 440 repeater in York from Lancaster
  - always surprised on their range.
  - thought UHF didn't go far.
- I built an Allstar node
  from a PI 4 and a USB-C radio dongle
  to reach a fringe repeater.
- I'm looking forward to FT challenge
- I stumbled into and recognized some Olivia-8/250 on 20M, and some SSTV
- I've been hearing lots of ISS repeater traffic at convenient times
  on my good ol' 1/4 wave antenna in the tree.
- I got the radio blog up-to-date with all my adventures.
