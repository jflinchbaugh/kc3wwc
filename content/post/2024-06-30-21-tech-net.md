### My Week in Radio
- outside wire broke and rehung a couple times
  - avoiding tension on it
  - cheap throwing weight from big sockets from Habitat Restore
- my first summer of HF: May not be as exciting as past Winter/Spring
- tape measure yagi for direction-finding/tx
  - Quansheng shows dB and S-level of the signal,
    so going to work nicely for direction-finding
  - found a direction-finding map application for my phone to help with triangulation:
    [SigTrax](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amcept.sigtrax)
  - may go chasing a curious source noises in my area
  - local club is gearing up for a tx hunt
- POTA / Field Day on the National Mall in DC
  - GRA-1900t whip with coil with jumper
    - noted resonant frequencies at each jumper fully extended,
      so lookup, jumper, then shorten to tune.
  - ran out all the batteries, but got the park activated
- POTA around York/Lancaster
  - oops, tick bite and lyme disease
- sorting all the gear for radio, electronics, other hobbies.
