Ben and I took the radio gear 
for a walk to Hawk Point
overlooking the river
in [Susquehannock State Park (US-1425)](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1425)
for a POTA activation.
We threw the 20m EFHW
into the trees in an inverted-V.
I checked the SWR on 15M,
and it came in about 1.5:1 or so.

I could hear really well with it,
and I contacted Argentina, Texas, California, and Italy
among other closer places on 15M FT8.
I spun the dial down to 20M SSB
to hear a park in Illinois,
but it was busy 
and the sun was setting quick,
so I didn't wait to try to make contact.

I'll have to try the other bands next,
but my randomly starting up on 15M
worked great.

Using the little box
as a winder for the wire
didn't work out so well.
It became an immediate tangle
as I tried to unwind it.
I'll switch to a 3d-printed winder instead.
