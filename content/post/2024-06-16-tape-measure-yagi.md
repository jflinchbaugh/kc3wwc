There are easy instructions
to [build your own yagi](https://www.instructables.com/The-Tape-Measure-Antenna/)
on Instructables.
I had just picked up
some hose clamps
and had the other necessary pieces:
a broken tape measure
and some 3/4-inch schedule 40 PVC and connectors;
so I was ready to build.

The wiring on mine is held in place
by the clamps and banana clip adapter.
I always like those for prototyping.
As directed,
I tuned the antenna
by moving radiators in and out
and measuring with the NanoVNA.

The antenna is noticeably directional,
so I can use it to find directions of signals.
The S-meter and dB signal strength numbers
on AUBS firmware
make it easy
to evaluate strength and direction.

I transmitted with it
to the [K3IR repeater](https://k3ir.org/)
as a test during a net.
