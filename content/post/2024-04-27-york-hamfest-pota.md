### [York Hamfest](https://www.yorkhamfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2024-York-Hamfest.pdf)

I ran to York for the Hamfest
and I saw a handful
of new friends
from SPARC and 985.
I only bought some BNC adapters,
a speaker that's OK but not great,
and a wireless keyboard/touchpad 
for my Raspberry PI projects.

### POTA

While I was out,
I figured I may as well play
a little radio
and activate 2 parks.

#### Codorus, [US-1342](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1342)

I ran the 12.5m EFRW stretched from high in a tree to a picnic table.
I started at the picnic table, but moved into the car when it started to rain.
To reach the car, I stretched my coax a bit and camped that to the table,
and I ended up with _no signal_. The feed cable (RG174 with SMA connectors)
had pulled loose from the SMA connector, 
so I had to debug that and push them back together.
I operated 17m mostly, FT8, 
and contacts came a bit slow.

#### Sam Lewis, [US-1418](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1418)

This time I stung up the 21.56m EFRW, 
2-3m off ground on ends, 
stretched between trees,
and a fishing pole mast supporting the middle peak.
17m was still a bit slow,
but 40m was hopping for FT8. 
I had a steady stream of contacts.

Before packing up, I spun the dial
and found a park-to-park SSB on 40m:
2 operators on one radio 
at the intersection of 4 parks in Canada,
so that counted for 8 hunter points.
