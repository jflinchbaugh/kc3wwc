I headed back to
[US-1418, Sam Lewis](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1418)
to tried a quick activation
on my way to my parents' house,
but I got sidetracked.
KN3A, Scott, was already there,
so I chatted with him for a few minutes,
and then setup my station
on the other side of the park.
I used my GRA-1900T for a quick setup
on 20m.
I saw Scott hunting up the band
with his big, very local, signal,
and then set out to do some FT8.
The band was busy,
but then just shut off nearing 1900UTC.

I heard about a storm coming
from the local repeaters.
I tried a bit on 15m,
but decided to pack up as I heard more thunder.
I only got a few contacts,
since I didn't give myself near enough time.
