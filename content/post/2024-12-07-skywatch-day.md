7 December was apparently Skywatch Appreciation Day,
so a station in Mount Holly,
[WX2PHI](https://www.qrz.com/db/WX2PHI),
was celebrating
by making contacts on the [N3KZ repeater system](https://n3kz.com/),
so at 5:15pm EST, I keyed up my HT to the mobile antenna on my car
and reported 32F and clear sky.
It was good to know I could key up the N3KZ node in York
from over here in Lancaster.
