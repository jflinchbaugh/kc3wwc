The ISS passed at 8:55am EDT
at 49 degrees.
My vertical 1/4-wave ground plane antenna
in the tree
picked it up really well.
I copied a handful of callsigns pretty easily:
- KO4PDI - FL
- KC4Y - AL
- K4MMD - FL
- N5ACR - MD
- KC4YMT - GA
- KC3MM - SC
- K3DMM - PA, Harrisburg

I confirmed hearing K3DMM
on the Morning Grind round table (K3IR)
a few minutes later that morning.
