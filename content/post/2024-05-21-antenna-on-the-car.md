I disassembled the inexpensive mag-mount antennas
that I had stuck to a baking sheet
in the back of the BMW i3 (all plastic).
The bike rack is always
on the car,
so removed the magnet
from the antenna,
and I cobbled together
some scrap metal parts
to clamp the antenna
onto the rack.
It's got a screw knob,
so I can loosen and reorient it
when I raise and lower the bike rack.

It works great now
with the antenna
outside the car
and attached to the metal of the rack.
