I removed the magnet
from the inexpensive mag-mount antenna
that I had stuck to a baking sheet
in the back of the BMW i3 (which is all plastic).
The bike rack is always
on the car,
so I cobbled together
some scrap metal parts
and clamped the antenna
onto the rack.
It's got a screw knob,
so I can loosen and reorient it
when I flip the bike rack.

It works great now
with the antenna
outside the car
and attached to the metal of the rack.
