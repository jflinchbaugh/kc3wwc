I added some sections to the flagpole
to reach 37 feet,
and I increased elements
on the home-made yagi
from 2 elements to 4 elements.
Upon adding elements,
I needed to stretch the driven element a couple millimeters longer
to tune it.
In testing,
I'm seeing about -100 RSSI listening to W3GMS on a Quansheng.
It was about -105 RSSI when mounted lower and only 2 elements.
