The HT app presented the firmware update right away
upon launching,
so now I know it can do the upgrade.
The first time I updated the radio,
I used the older "BTech Programmer" app.

The update promises some fixes around
- `ack` in in-built APRS,
- TNC stability

I discovered in the app the setting:
Radio -> ID Settings -> 3 Checkboxes (ID, Location, Check)
could be turned off to get to "none" to disable post-TX noises,
which is "PTT Release" in the radio.

Those settings kept getting synced
from the app to the radio,
so now they're set the way I want it to stay.
I could have also disabled "Synchronous Signal Settings"
in the app,
but the mismatch seems
like it would have been confusing.
