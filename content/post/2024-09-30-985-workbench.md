### My Week in Radio
- I moved the tape-measure yagi
  to the top of a 25-foot flagpole
  in the backyard.
  - 10 W, but not quite doing it.
  - There's still too much of a hill.
- I upgraded the X6100 baseband,
  stock firmware,
  and 3rd-party firmware.
- Some CW
  - barely got 2 CW contacts hunting POTA, but I got into their logs
  - heard AF3Z on 40m out on his trip
  - [morsle](https://morsle.fun/) app
    to practice copying CW words and call signs
- I redesigned and printed a new antenna winder.
- I heard some AM and some RTTY during contests.
- I cleaned up and organized all the radio stuff
  from the move
  instead of contesting.
- I'm going to try for my extra ticket at the next Ham Fest.
