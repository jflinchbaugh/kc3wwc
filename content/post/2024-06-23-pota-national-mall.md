I was traveling
to DC
the weekend of ARRL Field Day,
so I found some time
e-bike from the hotel
to activate [US-0655, the National Mall](https://pota.app/#/park/US-0655)
from a park bench at the mall.
I clamped the GRA-1900T right to the bench.
Field Day was happening,
so traditional bands were very busy.
I jumped to 17m for a quieter,
POTA-only experience.
The LiFePO4 battery hadn't been charged in a while,
so it went dead by the end of my activation.
It was a bit of a race against the dwindling battery.
With the battery completely exhausted,
and running on the internal battery
of the x6100,
I got to 12 contacts.

I had played with
the radio the night before.
I tried my gra-1900T
and the 12.5m EFRW
in the hotel room.
We were on the 9th floor of 10 floors
in Downtown DC.
I barely got out for a moment on 40m with the wire,
then nothing.
The whip did absolutely nothing.
