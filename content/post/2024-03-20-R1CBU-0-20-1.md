I updated my X6100 to 
[R1CBU 0.20.1](https://www.r1cbu.ru/index.php/home/radio-software/x6100/19-patch-firmware-v0-20-1).
Oleg provided a `tgz` 
with only the updated files,
so I dropped the file into `/DATA` partition, 
started up the radio,
and it unpacked the update.
The `tgz` contained the `x6100_ui` binary and `params.db`.

This can be an interesting way to make my own updates without needing
to know how to rebuild the entire image.
I see the changes applied to his
[`x6100_gui` github repo](https://github.com/strijar/x6100_gui),
so I know that's a good base 
for making future changes.

Learning to do make updates
is interesting,
because the original maintainer, Oleg,
is likely done updating this firmware
in favor of building his own radio 
in the image of the X6100.
He's frustrated trying to get
help and documentation
from Xiegu.
I run the R1CBU firmware full-time.
