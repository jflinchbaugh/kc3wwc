### My Week in Radio
- I met some 985ers on Friday morning 
  at the tailgate and breakfast.
- I heard a bit of the ARISS mission talking to students last week
- I have APRS working
  - UV-K5 running egzumer
    - VOX mode
    - Sensitive
  - Pixel 6 Pro
    - Volumes way up, nearly 100%
  - BTech audio cable
  - APRSDroid
    - AFSK mode
  - Saw decodes on the phone
  - Saw myself show up on https://aprs.fi map
- Evolve 3 laptop is working with Linux completely:
  - network
  - sound
  - used it for a pota activation
- Time to also slim down the go box for POTA as it's gotten heavy.
- 2m dipole in the tree working well for a couple weeks, 
  so it's time to change.
  - next: try building a ground-plane quarter-wave with radials
  - it'll feed better from the bottom
- Trying other firmware on the Quansheng radios
  - mixes of features I want and don't want
- W3FIS, Paul Ross, sent me a small box of some radio gadgets to explore
- I've been seeing people recommend using a CW decoder
  - maybe try the decoder in my radio
  - get some practice keying, instead of waiting
- York Hamfest is on Saturday
