The bands were dead
with the terrible geomagnetic storm this weekend,
so HF is very limited.
I was only able to contact Lititz from Mountville.

With the downtime,
I built some new EFHW antennas.
I tied some wires to trees, stretched them out,
and tuned each of the 2 20m EFHW antennas with the NanoVNA:
one speaker wire, and the other lightweight silicone wire.
I built new ununs and mounted them in plastic gum cases
and a 3D-printed winder.

I also cut a lightweight EFRW, 12.5m,
from the silicone wire
and gave it a gum case as a winder.

I'll test the new antennas soon
when the bands are better.
