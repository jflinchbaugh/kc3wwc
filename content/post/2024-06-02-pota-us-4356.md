After a bike ride in Harrisburg,
I visited [US-4356, Boyd Big Tree Preserve](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4356).
I used the 20m EFHW sloped up into a tree
near the main pavilion.
I spoke to a park in Western PA,
and a museum ship on Great Lakes
in Toledo, OH.
15m FT4 was busy
with lots of contesting,
so I also ran some FT8 on 20m.

The go-box is over-stuffed again with extra rope.
I need to slim it down again.
