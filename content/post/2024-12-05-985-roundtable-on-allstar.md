I used my Allstar for tonight's 985 Roundtable as a test,
since my antenna had been blowing around all day.
I wasn't not sure which way it would be pointing.

It's really easy to miss the first word or 2,
or prefixes of callsigns.
I was listening along on RF as well.
I got 2 random restarts of the Allstar connection,
and I learned that
I can't send any commands to the radio
while the node is transmitting simplex on RF.

The 985 Winter Field Day
will be at Lines Self Storage
in Chester Springs, PA.
