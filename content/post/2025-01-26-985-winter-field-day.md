The 985 group held their
winter field day at Lines Self Storage.
They had 5 stations in trailers and tents.
They worked some satellites and mostly HF.
There was hundreds of feet of coax feed line
all over the place.

I aw KC3NZT, Harvey, operating a satellite station
with special hardware.
Harvey also called CQ on HF.
He's a machine,
logging hundreds of QSOs.

I used a headphone splitter to listen
to another operator, Bob.
I copied some CW, but not a lot.
I listened for some digital and found a bit of RTTY,
but it was for the BARTG contest, not WFD.
I made some SSB contacts
on others' radios that were setup
for the weekend.

I hung my rolled slim-jim to call on 146.520MHz
and beacon some APRS,
but I heard nothing.
I could also check winlink email through
the N3MEL gateway in Downingtown.
I had looked it up ahead of time.
In the notes in WoAD,
I list the frequency where the gateway listens
for packets.

I visited during daytime on both days,
but did not stay overnight like some did.
