A new 
[R1CBU firmware](https://www.r1cbu.ru/index.php/home/radio-software/x6100/16-formware-v0-20-0)
is available for the X6100.

I wrote the image to the micro SD card:
```
$ sudo dd if=x6100_r1cbu_v0.20.0_sdcard.img bs=1M of=/dev/sdb status=progress
```

It's working fine. Auto levels 
for waterfall and spectrum seems useful,
but it still shows the min/max level settings 
that do nothing while in auto.
I had to set up all preferences again,
since it comes with a new database
on the image.
