### SPARC Elmer Night

I spent the Elmer Night tuning EFHW again with the NanoVNA.
I proved that I saw the same graph
when the antenna
was stretched shallow
vs a higher inverted-V.

I tried folding back the EFHW wire.
It changed the tuning slower
than cutting the wire.
DX Engineering has a video about this.
I didn't get it finished at the meeting,
since because it got dark.

### Memorial Day WeekendPOTA US-4361, Kings Gap Environmental Center

Matthew and I setup at
[Kings Gap Environmetal Center (US-4361)](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4361)
near the campground.
I spent the most the time still slowly tuning my EFHW,
and then dodging the rain.
I barely made any contacts
by the time I got the antenna in the air,
and then the thunderstorms returned.
We bailed,
and I put the antenna up back at the campground
strung over the site from tree to my fishing pole to telephone pole
for the rest of the weekend.
The twisted cords I've been using started unwinding,
so it's soon time to replace it with braided mason line.
