I had too many spots coming
from [Ham Alert](https://hamalert.org/),
, so it disabled itself on my phone.
I had experimented
with having everyone in one big alert.
I removed one really active FT8 user,
because I think they may have been the busiest.
I ended up breaking triggers
into groups based on clubs.
