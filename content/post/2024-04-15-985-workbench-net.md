  - eclipse
  - 21.56 efrw
  - operated next to my brother, kc3wry from the same picnic table
  - I worked 10m and he worked 40m
  - our data logs will be used my HAMSCI people, University of Scranton
- Caught Pitcairn Island DXpedition, VP6G, on 5w FT8 10m.
  - operating shifted, and was super quiet
  - my first OC
- Operating HT at 5W
  - dipole high in a tree
  - too sensitive for this cheap HT
  - FM bandstop filter to clean up the reception, especially for 985
  - TX though it without any fire!
- Modified the database in my hf radio to mark the bandplan
  on the waterfall
- started a website for all my notes since october

### 985 Breakfast on Friday
- Lots of coax, antennas, analyzers, etc for sale.

### Halyard on dipole install
- AF3Z, Jim
- Having a full halyard loop of rope to the pulley
  (like a flagpole)
  allows you to pull it up or down,
  whatever is needed.
- Avoids having a pulley up the tree with no rope
  because an end gets away.

### Dipole in the Attic
- KCYYIT, Dave
- Built the fan dipole for 6m and 10m in the attic.
- Tuned it with nanovna
- Not too tricky or ambitious: only the 2 bands.

### Mud Mosey
- Event at great marsh institute
- Course marshals used gmrs ch 17.
- 10 ham operators to help coordinate operations.
- Used simplex freq 147.12MHz
- Tom was net control

### APRS
- KC3YVQ, Jack
- Does APRS kerchunk N3FYI?
  - We don't think so. It should transmit and receive
    on standard 144.390MHz
