I attended the [SPARC](https://k3ir.org/) member meeting tonight
and heard about lots of interesting plans.
They have some fun events coming up,
like a [fox hunt](https://www.arrl.org/direction-finding), 
some antenna building to prepare for the fox hunt,
and even some POTA outings.
They'll also start planning for
[field day](https://www.arrl.org/field-day).

The main presentation was 
about the recent [Dry Tortugas DXpedition](https://www.qrz.com/db/N4T).

I went home and sent my member application right away.
