### My Week in Radio
- My favorite way to learn things: experiments
  - diagnose and repair a bad coax cable
    - no continuity on center conductor
    - plugged it into the nano vna, switched to smith chart
      - saw a big spiral around the outside
      - no change in the graph on the other side
      - compared to a working cable
      - it should have spiraled
      - maybe alonger spiral for a longer cable
  - 71 foot random wire with 5W is not needing the tuner
    - disconnected lots of different places
      and checked lots of SWR without those connections
- Tossed a wire into a tree at Swatara State Park today
  for some POTA contacts
- Operated the last 2 hours of the RTTY contest on 10m, 15m, and 20m.
