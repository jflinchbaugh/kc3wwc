I watched a [video about NVIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pV9031XgnU)
NVIS achieves 75-90 degree take-off, very vertical,
and about a 400-mile range.
It can get you over obstacles.
It's most effective on 40m and 80m.

To build it,
mount a dipole 1/8 wavelength above ground, horizontal.
Add a reflector almost on the ground, 5% longer,
to keep the ground from absorbing the signal.
