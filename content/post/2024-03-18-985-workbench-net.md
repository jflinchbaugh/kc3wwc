### This Week in Ham Radio
- I keep tweaking the outside 2m dipole
  - I got it a little higher
  - It tests different day to night
  - Signal is good then gone every so many seconds
  - Checked it for loose connections in the wind. It seems fine.
- I've been learning to configure fldigi more
- [BARTG RTTY contest](https://bartg.org.uk/wp/bartg-hf-rtty-contest/) 
   over the weekend
  - I finally successfully ran the frequency
    for a bit calling cq and getting responses
  - I stuck to the 5W QRP class
- I'm scanning more frequencies for satellite repeaters
- Weather is nicer, 
  so I got out on my bicycle.
  It's time to activate some parks 
  (on the bike?).
  The Tram mirror mount 
  for vertical antenna 
  might clamp nicely 
  to the bag rack.
