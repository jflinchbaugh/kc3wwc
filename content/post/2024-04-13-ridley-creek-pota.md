We had some time in West Chester
to visit Ben and see the new Mini Countryman, 
so I stopped by [Ridley Creek State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1414)
to activate.
I had lots of tangles trying to toss my 21.56m EFRW
into a tree -- it took 30 minutes just to get started,
but I had the wire at least 25 feet into the air.
I operated FT8 and FT4 on 10m from a pavilion.
I hit lots of Western US, some Europe, Brazil, and even New Zealand!
